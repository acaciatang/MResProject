BEEtag: A Low-Cost, Image-Based Tracking System for the Study of Animal Behavior and Locomotion
- must cite, is the tagging system we will be using
- has stuff on how to find tags and program, how they found thresholds for recognition, how to attach tags, 
- but content is just describing the system

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Neonicotinoid exposure disrupts bumblebee nest behavior, social networks, and thermoregulation
- very similar methods as what i will be doing except different treatment
- even analysis
- can reference how they defined behaviours too


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Standard methods for research on Apis mellifera gut symbionts
- will not be part of project per se but can cite methods to extract DNA from sample for future study
- alternatively "The gut microbiome defines social group membership in honey bee colonies" just washed and froze the bee

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The honey bee gut microbiota: strategies for study and characterization
- not that useful
- basic review of methods used to characterise microbiomes without details

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pollen reverses decreased lifespan, altered nutritional metabolism and suppressed immunity in honey bees (Apis mellifera) treated
with antibiotics
- not that useful
- found that pollen could reverse the adverse effects of antibiotics, but did not loop at actual community
- also, they got pollen from field colonies which is not feasible
- honestly they probably just re-inoculated the bees with whatever was on the pollen

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Antibiotic exposure perturbs the gut microbiota and elevates mortality in honeybees
- not super useful
- can cite to demonstrate that people have been looking at the effects of antibiotics on bees
- but they used a different antibiotic (tetracycline, we use streptomycin)
- anyway, 4 species out of 8 cores decreased in abundance
- interestingly, found that G. apicola was higher

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Honeybee microbiome is stabilized in the presence of propolis
- not helpful
- added propolis traps which increasing propolis production [is this glue that honey bees (not bumblebees which we are using) make]
- found that microbiome was different
- with less propolis, microbiome was different (more Bartonella and Lactobacillus)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lactobacillus spp. attenuate antibiotic-induced immune and microbiota dysregulation in honey bees
- used tetracycline on bees
- this lowered parasite count but only in larvae
- lowered stability (microbiomes more different), diversity
- Lactobacillus treatment after tetracycline led to enrichment of core species, increased expression of immune and anti-oxidant genes
- G. apicola unaffected by tetracycline

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
New evidence showing that the destruction of gut bacteria by antibiotic treatment could increase the honey beeâ€™s vulnerability to Nosema infection
- used same anti-biotic, can use dosage as reference
- found that it lowered immune gene expression and increased mortality
- so we expect the treatment bees to die more
- all bees dead  by 14 days with treatment group
- for control, not all dead but most dead by 25 days
- problem: absolutely no idea what the treatment did to the microbiome

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Applications of machine learning in animal behaviour studies
- review of use of machine learning in ecology
- has some stuff that can be used to help choose the right method, if it comes to that
- probably want supervised learning?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Novel probiotic approach to counter Paenibacillus larvae infection in honey bees
- not useful
- is about use of probiotics to suppress parasite infection

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Are commercial probiotics and prebiotics effective in the treatment and prevention of honeybee nosemosis C?
- used Lactobacillus rhamnousus and inulin
- mortality increase with just Lactobacillus rhamnosus or both, regardless of presence of pathogen
- inulin has no effect
- they think it might be competition for nutrients with host, or lactic acid fucking up the gut, or probiotics out-competing symbionts

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tracking All Members of a Honey Bee Colony Over Their Lifetime Using Learned Models of Correspondence
- not very useful
- think they just made another version of BEEtag
- BUT! they have a huge database of bee recordings that maybe I can use
- BUT BUT! They used honey bees and the set-up is different from what I will have

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Automated computer-based detection of encounter behaviours in groups of honeybees
- again, honey bees
- more useful, can cite time they used to train and methods to train computer to learn bee behaviour if I actually do this
- don't know enough about machine learning to tell if I can just use this system though

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The dynamics of animal social networks: analytical, conceptual, and theoretical advances
- review of network analysis methods
- temporal, spatial, and individual variation are of particular interest to this project
- temporal: methods are given along with R packages that can be used
- spatial: no current method explicitly for this but can modify existing methods
- individual: no current method they think removing the individual of interest might work but the bees are dying so uh no
- unless...?
