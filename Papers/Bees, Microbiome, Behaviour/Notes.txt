The gut microbiome defines social group membership in honey bee colonies
- is honey bees though
- microbes make CHC profiles different
- bees reject others with different microbes aka CHC profiles, but only have the one that makes it. Otherwise just seems 50-50
	**they used newly emerged bees
- get difference from older bees
- G. apicola is the one maybe? Have populational differences between colonies

other references
- how to treat bees for 16S sequencing
- antibiotic: they use a mixture of tetracycline, rifampicin, streptomycin
- treatment was done for 15 days

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The gut microbiome is associated with behavioural task in honey bees
- some marginally significant differences found between foragers and nest workers

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Social behaviour in bees influences the abundance of Sodalis (Enterobacteriaceae) symbionts
- not that useful
- found that microbe communities are similar, sociality and mutualistic(? they just say symbiosis) are not correlated
- but for me: cites papers about how to recognise nascent obligate symbioses, which is pretty cool

The Gut-Brain-Microbiome Axis in Bumble Bees
- visual assay to determine if no inoculation of microbiome after metamorphosis affected visual learning and memory
- it didn't

other things
- some references might be useful? cites papers about nest-mate recognition and learning in other species
- did not demonstrate effect of treatment on microbiome

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The different dietary sugars modulate the composition of the gut microbiota in honeybee during overwintering
- not useful
- found differences of microbes depending on food but will be giving the same food to all and also will just be following an established protocol

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Modulation of the honey bee queen microbiota: Effects of early social contact
- not useful
- Found that queens had a more variable microbiome when isolated from workers at start of life and that effect persists

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Microbiota associated with pollen, bee bread, larvae and adults of solitary bee Osmia cornuta (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae)
- not useful
- just isolated microbes from different sources related to bees that aren't even the species I'm using
